Testing out some python features

## Branches
The branch "main" is what should be your most stable branch, you don't merge any code to this unless you know it works. This is your deliverable product.

I've created the branch "develop" where we can test features together.

You may notice some other branches that have other names. These branches should only be used for singular features, and deleted once the feature has been merged to "develop".

### Branch Example:

You want to change the walking speed of the main character. You would create a branch forked from the "develop" branch and name it "update-walking-speed" (some companies have different naming conventions, we should decide on this ahead of time). At the same time, I want to add a new file for the NPCs dialog. I would create a branch from "develop" called "new-npc-dialog".

Once you were done with updating the walking speed, you would test out your changes on your own computer, then open a pull request for others to review then merge to "develop". I would do the same for my "new-npc-dialog" branch. 

When the features are tested together in develop and shown to work consistently, we would merge them to the "main" branch.

Rule of thumb: If you are going to make a code commit directly to the main branch, it better have a good reason!!!!
